# Power Putty I/O

Power Putty I/O provides abstractions for components that need to read or 
write data and files in a consistent way.

Setup your `Source`s of data, whether they're files, buffers, raw strings,
or streams. Then use an `Engine` to read and write that data to some system,
whether that's local storage, S3, or somewhere else. Then, store that 
metadata in an `Upload`.

## Usage

```
require('power-putty-io');

// TODO: DEMONSTRATE API
```
